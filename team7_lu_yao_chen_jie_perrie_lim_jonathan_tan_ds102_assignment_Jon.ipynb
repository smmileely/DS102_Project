    "\n",
    "Global university ranking seems to be a perennial source of interest for Singaporeans as it is often used as a benchmark to ascertain if universities meet our expectations of world-class status. However, rankings tend to place emphasis on research publications of global significance. There is some skepticism that high university rankings do not cause or even correlate with national economic performance. Also, there is no definitive link to individual student outcomes like post-graduation job placement or salary rates. With the education ministry putting specific resources and areas of study that falls in line with the evolving job market, looking at these areas might be a better predictor of what affects a graduate’s employability. \n",

    "<b>Hypothesis: </b>\n",
    "(1) The university standing does not determine the employment rate and monthly salary;\n",
    "(2) A better predictor of employment rate and monthly salary would be the course of study. \n",
